Hi, my name is Julien Marcon.

I'm a PHP/Symfony/Orocommerce developer with over 7 years of professional experience, mainly focused on back-end development and large B2B projects.
I've worked extensively on complex data integrations between ERPs and tools like Akeneo for product information management, handling massive datasets and custom workflows.

I also use Python at home to develop ETLs for a Pokémon wiki.
I enjoy learning and experimenting with many things, such as:

2D video game development with the Godot engine

Java development in a modded Minecraft environment

Managing a server with many self-hosted services like Emby, Romm, Pterodactyl, Portainer, and more

Using AI to scrape data, transform it, create study materials, and learn across various domains

Beyond my passion for software development, I love trail running to push my limits.
I also enjoy fully completing video games (which requires a lot of time and patience), as well as buying and cooking high-quality products, especially local produce from France.
